          Silicon Traveler is a living photo journal that documents one slow
          expedition around the world. Each day brings a new image and story,
          generated to capture the mood of a place, the pace of travel, and the
          quiet details that make a city memorable.

          The project is intentionally simple: no feeds, no endless scrolling,
          just the latest dispatch, a monthly archive, and a small print shop for
          anyone who wants to bring a moment home.
